# DevToolAssignment2023

For Lee Sandberg

I tried to mark everything I changed or added with a comment for ex //Edited bt William Isacsson or something like that. May have missed some few places.

The custom inspector/Tool I crated is for the AsteroidType ScriptableObjects. I put all of my stuff inside a folder called William so you should find everything you need in there for grading.
